  about:
    " 304 (Pronounced 'three nought four') is a card game popular in South India. It is a four-player partnership point-trick game with bidding. From the rank and value of the cards, with the Jack and Nine promoted above the Ace, it is clear that it belongs to the Jass family, which originated in the Netherlands. It is probable that 304 is derived from a game brought to Sri Lanka by Dutch traders in the 17th or 18th century.",
